# # Lesson 1: Using files in Python
# 
# Hit the play button on the video next to this Jupyter notebook to start the video and follow along as Andrew explains how to work through this lesson.
# 
# So far, if you have taken the previous courses in this sequence, 
# * You have worked with data that is created and assigned to variables within Jupyter notebooks.
# * You have created multi-line strings.
# * You have created lists and dictionaries.
# * You have automated tasks using `for` loops and `if` statements.
# 
# 
# In this lesson, you will read files using Python!
# 
# Let's start by loading some functions you'll use in this notebook:

# In[1]:


from helper_functions import get_llm_response
from IPython.display import display, Markdown


# * Write a prompt to create a recipe using `get_llm_response`.

# In[2]:


# Write a list of ingredients
ingredients = ['chicken', 'broccoli', 'rice']

# Write the prompt
prompt = f"""
    Create a short recipe that uses the following ingredients:
    {ingredients}
"""

# Get the response from the LLM
response = get_llm_response(prompt)

# Print the LLM response
print(response)


# ## Opening a text file and saving it as a string

# You will load data that has already been created and is stored üìÅ for you in files.
# 
# * Start by loading an email that Daniel sent recently. It is stored in a '.txt' file.

# In[3]:


f = open("email.txt", "r")
email = f.read()
f.close()


# * Print what it is 'inside' the email ‚úâÔ∏è.

# In[4]:


print(email)


# <p style="background-color:#F5C780; padding:15px"> ü§ñ <b>Use the Chatbot</b>:
#     <br><br>
#     Explain this code line by line:
#     <br><br>f = open("email.txt", "r")
#     <br>email = f.read()
#     <br>f.close()
# </p>

# <p style="background-color:#F5C780; padding:15px"> ü§ñ <b>Use the Chatbot</b>:
#     <br><br>
#     What happens if I don't close a file?
# </p>

# ## Using LLMs to extract bullet points from the email

# * Create a prompt to extract bullet points from Daniel's email ‚úâÔ∏è.

# In[ ]:


prompt = f"""Extract bullet points from the following email. 
Include the sender information. 

Email:
{email}"""

print(prompt)


# * Run the ```get_llm_response``` function to get the response with bullet points.

# In[ ]:


bullet_points = get_llm_response(prompt)
print(bullet_points)


# * Print the LLM response in Markdown format.

# In[ ]:


# Print in Markdown format
display(Markdown(bullet_points))


# ## Extra practice
# 
# Try the exercises below to get an LLM to carry out different tasks using the email text you read in from file:
# 
# ### Exercise 1
# 
# Complete the code below to identify all the **countries** mentioned in the email.

# In[ ]:


# Complete the code below to identify all of the countries mentioned 
# in the email
prompt = f"""WRITE YOUR PROMPT HERE

Email:
{email}
"""

countries = get_llm_response(prompt)
print(countries)


# ### Exercise 2
# 
# Write code below to list all of the activities that Daniel did on his trip. You'll need to create a prompt and use either `get_llm_response` or `print_llm_response`.

# In[ ]:


# Write code below to list all of the activities that Daniel did on 
# his trip. You'll need to create a prompt and use either 
# get_llm_response or print_llm_response
